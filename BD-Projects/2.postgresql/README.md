Second project for the Databases subject of the Computer Engineering Degree. 

## Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's intended to develop a database to manage information from a social network of cooking fans. To manage the network it's required to represent data about: members, recipes, friends and 'likes'.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About members, you should register: name, username (unique for each member), birth country, living city and birth date. Members have friends (if member A if friend of member B, member B is friend of member A). Members have recipes and can like other members recipes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All recipes have a name, a unique id, a list of ingredients with quantity or unity, one or more pictures and a description. All recipes can be desserts, appetizers or main courses. Main courses allways have portion number. Desserts have allways facility level (easy, medium or hard), and the other types os recipes don't display facility level. All recipes have confection time and cost ($, $$, $$$) and a level corresponding to the likes average. A like' can hav a value between 1 and 3 stars.
