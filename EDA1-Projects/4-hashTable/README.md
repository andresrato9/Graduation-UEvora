# Text Corrector
Fourth project for the Data Structures and Algorithms I subject of the Computer Engineering Degree. 

## 1. Objectives - Usage and Binary Seacrh Trees Implementation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's intended that you implement **Hash Tables**, in an efficient way and provide a program that uses this data structure to create a text corrector.  

## 2. The Project  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project consists of the presentation of a package consisting of a text corrector using hash tables. Assume the existence of a single dictionary (which is give to you) and which allows you to check if the words tat appear in a text are correct or not.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your job is to receive a text, and list all misspelled words in the give text. The line of the text in which the wrong word was found should appear too. Must also for each incorrect word suggest corrections.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There corrections should be obtained by consulting the dictionary, applying one of the following rules:  
* add a letter;  
* remove a letter;  
* swap two consecutive letters;  
* change a letter (extra).
